- [Segment 1](#Segment1)
- [Segment 2](#Segment2)

## Segment 1: Pollution Estimation
The first segment takes in the values of PM10 and PM2.5, which are common indicators of air pollution. The output of this segment is a pollution estimate based on these input values.

## Segment 2: Air Quality Evaluation
The second segment takes the pollution estimate from the first segment and combines it with the average wind speed. The output of this segment is an overall air quality assessment.
